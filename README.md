Dataset Name: Medical Insurance

Objective of the Project: The objective of this project is to identify the best-performing machine learning model to predict medical insurance premiums based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more.

Project Description: This project explores various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps like cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and analyzing descriptive statistics. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) highlighted trends, such as the positive correlation of age and BMI with charges and the significant impact of smoking on premium costs. The models were evaluated based on performance metrics, with Random Forest showing the best results.

Conclusion: Random Forest proved to be the most effective model for predicting medical insurance premiums, offering the best accuracy and reliability for premium determination.
